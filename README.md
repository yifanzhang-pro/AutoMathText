## Introduction 

Official implementation of ACL 2025 Findings paper "Autonomous Data Selection with Zero-shot Generative Classifiers for Mathematical Texts" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07625).

**Featured as Huggingface Daily Papers! (https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.07625)**

**AutoMathText** is an extensive and carefully curated dataset encompassing around **200 GB** of mathematical texts. It's a compilation sourced from a diverse range of platforms including various websites, arXiv, and GitHub (OpenWebMath, RedPajama, Algebraic Stack). This rich repository has been **autonomously selected (labeled) by the state-of-the-art open-source language model**, Qwen-72B. Each piece of content in the dataset is assigned **a score `lm_q1q2_score` within the range of [0, 1]**, reflecting its relevance, quality, and educational value in the context of mathematical intelligence.
